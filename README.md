# Discord RPC made with pypresence

Objetive: Create a custom RPC that would show some information from my system on discord, for fun of course. According to clyde (discord's bot) this is not against the terms of use, so don't worry. That if you don't have any malicious ideas to apply in the RPC of course.

You've been warned!
